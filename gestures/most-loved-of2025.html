      <h1><a href="../gestures.html">/gestures/</a>most-loved-of2025</h1>
    <p>I'm writing this on the eve of new years eve. My roommate just left home for work which means I get to use our cherry-red hardwood table that's otherwise littered with bills and books and rubbish.<br>
      The whole point behind me making this website was that I could better emancipate myself from the remnants of an internet that is becoming increasingly harder to reconcile with my values and politics.<br>
    So now I'm using this new-found free-will to make my most abrasive and cutting-edge work to date : an itemized list of things I enjoyed this calendar year. Here are the categories :</p>
    
    <ul style="margin-left: 15%; ">

        <br><p>∭The Concordia 815 studio, in Mtl. </p>
        <br><p>∭Mon Café, in la Plaine Marseille, when those early wintersun rays hit</p>
        <br><p>∭The river bank, by the old flour factory, Montréal QC. especially in the summer. </p>
        <br><p>∭Rue Benoît Malon, Marseille, just the sweetest.</p>
        <br><p>∭The Alcazar Library, for its name, mostly, and the fact that it's an O shaped building where you can imagine the architect wanted both horizontal and vertical traversal.</p>
        <br><p>∭This cave on the Marseille shore where the water is knee-deep. The algae makes the floor look purple, and there's bits of human structures that make it feel like someone's minimalistic cave-house. A hole on the side lets out this guttural sound, a mineral sound system.</p>
        <br><p>∭The bull-statue overlooking Parc Longchamp. <i>I like to sit next to it and read.</i></p>
