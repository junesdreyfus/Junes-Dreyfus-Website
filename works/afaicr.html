    <p style color>‘As Far As I Can Remember’ is a video-game project combining the digital archival of real-life places with their reclamation for political, communal, and artistic purposes.<br>
         The game sees you wandering around a reconstruction of a run-down apartment in the south of France, as it stood in April 2024. Its real-life counterpart exists in a sort of limbo state : while no longer legally accessible, it bears the markings of other peoples’ desires. Sleeping bags and picture-frames are sharing the same roof, layers upon layers of torn colorful wallpapers. A drawing of a house is etched on the staircase leading up to the apartment.<br><br>
 The video-game offers an alternate reality where those ambitions can still coexist, free from the hostility of real-estate speculations and the crushing weight of urban capitalism. It functions as a kind of storage space, a patchwork of preserved artefacts and anachronistic additions, assembled using handmade 3D models, photogrammetry, gleaned textures, and other DIY tech-practices. The viewer is invited to breathe in and explore, witnessing ghosts and air drafts alike.
