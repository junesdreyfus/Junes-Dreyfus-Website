    <p style color>This 3D patchwork-like structure is the result of my research in finding new ways of conceptualizing virtual social spaces in a post web2.0 world. It takes roots in the real life location of the Frederic Back park from where the textures, terrain formations and structures were pulled.<br><br>

As the user wanders, they encounter different layers of dynamic sounds, the exploration being as sonic as it is visual. The program rewards exploration both with visual asperities and sound-triggers.<br> One can orient themselves as they come to understand the space and its logic: the cave-like structure creates whipping echoes, the soil-spheres emit a buzzing sound and there is a low drone where the campfire must have been.<br> It is meant to work like a synthesizer, one runs their finger over a computer, traversing a space built for them with the relics of a landfill, creating sound and music. <br><br>

The space gives up visual coherence in the same gesture as it does conventional multiplayer interactions. It is not punitive, there is no fail-state, the gravity is operating on moon logic and you can virtually get anywhere you want. The users are not connected through servers but the game does take over the sound of the physical space it’s being played in, hopefully creating a similar shared space experience as old internet cafés or gaming dungeons. It exists as a virtual object, focused on communal experimentation, where the 3D chat room is turned outward rather than being a self contained closed-off world.
