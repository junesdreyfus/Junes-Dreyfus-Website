        I've been avoiding this specific street for the past few days, as I deemed not to be dressed well enough to see them. I've been in job-hunting mode thus
        my wardrobe has been restricting to a couple of ill-fitting work pants. I felt today that I could however use 
        a bit of that courage that seeing the women of that street gives me. It's very hilly, almost in a looney-toon's kind of way, the road
        unfurling with the faces of my sisters. I saw C. who told me that if I still couldn't find anything I could probably count on my "déesses", my goddesses.
        I laughed and said that I was indeed considering it, unsure if she meant what I thought she was saying. She then humiliated some poor guy, and so I left and giggled
        my way to the Alcazar.<br><br>

       <span style="color:orange">happy halloween</span>my neighbor is so loud.<br>
        I had to use mspaint for the placeholder (in the works section, very visible.)
         Those tools are wayy too refined for what they are while still lacking the most basic thing. I can't wait to have photoshop again.<br>

        these updates are getting too long. I'm sitting on the hotel bed, with my outside clothes still on.<br><br>
         I convinced my mom to do a hiking trip with me as I'm her funniest daughter. We've been in Stresa for about 3 days, and the charging
         holes are somehow too small to fit my computer's so I'm on limited time here.<br><br>

        <br><br>Yesterday I realized that structurally, the library building I spend
        most of my time working at (the Alcazar library in marseille, which I love,
        especially the name even though they don't have toilet paper which is psychotic)
        structurally resembles my previous den and free-time-black-hole A.K.A. the 
        Concordia building in Montréal (don't remember which one sorry.)
        <br><br>Both buildings are O shaped and have some amount of verticality. I like 
        that the one in Marseille has some banner hanging at each floors to say which 
        section is there, it makes me think of giant bookmarks. <br><br>

        <br><br>Aujourd'hui comme tous les jours depuis que je n'ai plus de studio je suis allée à la bibliothèque de l'Alcazar.
        <br>J'ai demandé à une fille de garder mon ordinateur pendant que je faisais pipi.
        <br><br>Elle avait l'air hyper contente que je lui parle<br><br>

        THIS WILL BE IN ITS OWN LITTLE SCROLLABLE DIALOG BOX (that way I can better format/add images:>)<br><br>
        I Might need to keep a 'FILM' button somewhere if i want it to remain in focus:7</p>
